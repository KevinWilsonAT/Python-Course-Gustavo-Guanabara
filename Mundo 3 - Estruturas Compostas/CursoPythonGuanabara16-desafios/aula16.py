# Tuples

#   syntax:
#       <tuple_name> = (<content1>, <content2>, ..., <contentN>)    OR
#       <tuple_name> = <content1>, <content2>, ..., <contentN>

#   To access, use:
#       print(<tuple_name>[<content_position>])

#   To order alphabetically, use:
#       print(sorted(<tuple_name>))

#   To show how many contents exists in the tuple, use:
#       print(len(<tuple_name>)

#   To count how many times something appeared in the tuple, use:
#       print(<tuple_name>.count(<the_content_to_count>))

#   To show how which position something is in the tuple (the first position this content appeared,
#   in case of repeated values), use:
#       print(<tuple_name>.index(<the_content_to_find_position>))

#   To join different tuples, use:
#       <tuple_name_joined> = <tuple_name_1> + <tuple_name_2>

#   About <content_position>:
#       none = Displays all contents of the tuple
#       [n] = Displays the content in position n
#       [-1] = Displays the content in the LAST position
#       [-2] = Displays the content in BEFORE THE LAST position
#       [n:m] = Displays the content FROM THE POSITION n to the POSITION BEFORE m
#       [n:] = Displays the content FROM THE POSITION n until the END of the tuple
#       [:n] = Displays the content FROM THE BEGINNING of the tuple to the POSITION BEFORE n

#   About attributions:
#       TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE (cannot be attributed a value to any content of the tuple, except in the declaration)

# To delete tuples, use:
#       del(<tuple_name>)
